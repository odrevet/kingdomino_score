# Bottom menu buttons

Each land type has it's own color :

The castle position may change the score when quests are activated.

* total points lost due to giants
* the score you could had have without giants

# TroubleShooting

## In the online version, crowns and castle are replaced with squares

You need to have emoticon support to display some graphics like crowns and castle.

Under Ubuntu :

```
sudo apt install fonts-emojione
```

and then set emojione as the standard font in your web browser
